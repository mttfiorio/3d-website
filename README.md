# threejs-coins

Testing Vite compiler together with Three.js rendering and Rapier physics engine capabilities.
The coins all have their own physics collider, they are generated randomly and bounce when hitting each other.
The coins that fall off the platform are removed from the scene in order to not instantiate infinite memory
